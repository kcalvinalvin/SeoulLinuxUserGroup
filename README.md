# Seoul Linux User Group

*Fabulous meetup for fabulous people*

## Introduction

As a Linux meetup and a proponent for FLOSS software, I decided to make a git repository for all things related in management of the meetup. From now on, the meetup organization will adapt the open source development model.

**Below rules are up for interpretation and not set in stone.** Think of them as more of an outline than word of law. If there are any questions to hosting/speaking, please do make an issue. I'll bend the rules below if deemed necessary.

## Offline meetups

### Speakers

**Anyone** is free to speak at the meetup barring that it meets below requirements.

#### 1. Topic must be related to Linux.
	A. Topics related to other operating systems are allowed
	barring that they be compared to Linux or have something
	to do with Linux.

	B. Topic *does not* have to be about computer science
	Feel free to talk about other aspects of Linux as well
	(ex. Freedom, philosophy, etc).

#### 2. Topic must not be better suited for an active meetup in the Seoul metropolitan area.
	Talking extensively about certain programming
	languages (Rust, Golang, etc) that have their own
	dedicated meetups is not allowed.

### Procedures for Requesting to Speak

Anyone wishing to speak should make a Pull Request with the following information:

#### 1. Title
#### 2. One sentence description of the talk
#### 3. One paragraph summary of the talk
#### 4. If the speaker needs a projector/screen for the talk (answer with yes/no)
#### Optional: Speaker's alias/name and association

**I'll review the Pull Request and confirm that they meet the above two rules for speakers. Then the meetup will be scheduled in accordance to the speaker's availability.**

### Meetup Hosting

Hosting is different from being a speaker in the sense that

| Speaking | Hosting |
|--|--|
|Scheduling and organization is done by me. The speaker is only responsible for the content at hand. |Scheduling and organization for the entirety of the event is done by the inquirer.  |


 **Anyone** is free to host a meetup under the Seoul Linux User Group meetup page and name barring that it meets these requirements listed.

#### 1. Meetup should be open to anyone

	ex. Must not be an invite only meetup.

#### 2. Meetup should be related to Linux

#### 3. Inquiry must be 2 weeks prior to the actual event

#### 4. Inquirer must not cancel the event 2 days prior to when the event was to take place.

	Life happens. If something comes up 2 days prior to the
	event, message me/make an issue.

### Procedures for Requesting to Host

**Anyone wishing to host should make a Pull Request with the following information:**

#### 1. One sentence description of what the meetup will be about
#### 2. One paragraph summary of what the meetup will be about
#### Optional: Inquirer's alias/name and association

**I'll review the Pull Request and confirm that they meet the above two rules for speakers. Then I will make a single event on the meetup page and make it editable for the inquirer.**
